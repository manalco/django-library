        "description": "Python is a powerful modern computer programming language and it is easy to learn. The syntax is simple and it allows the programmers to state their ideas in fewer lines of codes.\r\n\r\nIt is an interpreted language and no compilation is necessary. It is often used as a scripting language and it is available on Windows, Mac OS and UNIX operating systems.\r\n\r\nThe variable and argument declarations are not necessary as it is determined implicitly. One major advantage of using Python is that it is platform-independent and you can run it on any operating system without any issues.\r\n\r\nMany people are scared to get into any type of coding because they think that it will be too hard or that they will never be able to figure it all out. But when they take a look at Python, they see how easy coding can be.\r\n\r\nThat is what this guidebook took some time to look at this, and looked at some of the different codes that you want to write with this kind of coding language. We also took it a bit of the more advanced types of coding that you can do with this language as well, ensuring that you are going to be able to get the results that you would like.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of things that you are able to do with the Python language and how you can use it with machine learning. This guidebook is going to take some time to look at all of these aspects so you can do some of the codings in the process. When you are ready to begin your journey with Python, make sure to check out this guidebook to help you get started!",
